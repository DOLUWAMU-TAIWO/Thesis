The Integration and Evaluation of RISC V on FPGA for a FreeRTOS application.


The landscape of computer architecture is now more than ever evolving rapidly; this is in most part driven by the need for systems that are highly efficient and adaptable. There is also a demand for high-performance computing which is crucial in application areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this vein, RISC-V, which is an open-source ISA, has garnered significant attention. Its modular and customizable nature is a promising prospect for developing specialized systems as required by most Industry 4.0 applications.

RISC-V is built according to reduced instruction set computing principles, and what makes it stand out is its flexibility, simplicity, and modularity. Proprietary ISAs do not allow the level of freedom provided by RISC-V as regards development; this factor promotes collaboration and innovation in various sectors.


Our target platform is an FPGA. An FPGA underscores similar characteristics of RISC-V, like customizability and reconfigurability. The integration of RISC-V cores on an FPGA platform presents the opportunity to explore highly efficient, customisable computing systems.
We intend to test our system with an application after implementation. This will go in the direction of real-time operating systems. A real-time system demands timely and deterministic responses, which can only be achieved with a certain level of efficiency. The adaptability of RSIC-V cores combined with the flexibility of the FPGA could lead to a more efficient system that benefits the RTOS.
